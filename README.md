# Vue-cli SPA Example by Wallace

> This is a simple project made by Agile Content to showcase my skills on Javascript, CSS and HMLT. Besides these languages, I also chose to use Vuejs and Sass, creating a single page application. To run the project, simply access the root folder o this project on the navigator. The project is best viewed in Google Chrome and Opera.
